# Producer Nodes  

## Overview  

Streams of data are generated using Kafka producers for three data sources: 
pageviews, events, and displays, and sent into three different topics
 in the Kafka cluster.   
The pageviews stream is generated independent of other streams. 
The events and display streams need to be joined, so some alignment 
logic is implemented. These two streams are generated by running  
`event_to_topic.py`, with the script calling `display_to_topic.py` 
once in a specified interval of ID's.
 This directory also includes some scripts used for preprocessing the 
raw data into a form that is more readily used in the producers.  

## Operation  
To generate all streams, run  

```bash
sh ~/admorphous/create_streams.sh
```
